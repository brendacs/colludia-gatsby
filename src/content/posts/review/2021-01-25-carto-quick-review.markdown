Normally, I'm only able to move my character around to solve puzzles. In _Carto_, I could move my whole map around. As I did so, the landscape around me shifted and changed, new structures popped up, treasured opened themselves, and new friends appeared. With just a few movements of the map I was standing in, I could move clear across the land of Carto, from a grassland to river to a magical storybook building to the middle of a sandstorm.

That simple, yet amazingly smooth and unique mechanic is just the charm of _Carto_â€”not to mention the fun-filled adventure, vibrant characters and illustrations, enticing story, and plucky little protagonist. My recommendation: pick up _Carto_ immediately. This short, yet densely-packed game with its quiet, but intelligent heroine who stumbles into a dozen adventures while trying to find her grandmother will capture your attention for hours... and your heart for much longer.
