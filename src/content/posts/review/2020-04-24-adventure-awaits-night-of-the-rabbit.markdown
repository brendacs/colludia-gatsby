Jerry Hazelnut, a young boy on his very last day of summer vacation, has always wanted to be a magician. With the help of a particular white rabbit (or, is Jerry helping the rabbit?), his once in a lifetime chance to fulfill his dream has come. Suddenly, the mundane world that he’s so used to living in is full of a different kind of life—a mystical kind of life.

As a writer who dreamed a whole bunch as a child, [_The Night of the Rabbit_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/230820/The_Night_of_the_Rabbit/) made me relive the time when I had nothing to worry about except how to spend my summer days. If I could describe this game in one sentence, it is setting out on an adventure without worrying when you’ll be back, full of energy and the potential to change the world.

## A Nice Day To Be A Mouse

Mousewood, home to mice, friends, and an impending evil. As the player, you get to guide Jerry through the story in this magical place in the forest. Meet curious, kind, and grumpy characters as you chase the white rabbit in a quest for peace.

Fans of [Daedalic Entertainment](https://twitter.com/daedalic?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) games probably know that the storytelling will be excellent. _The Night of the Rabbit_ is no exception, especially with the beautiful voice acting for the narration and characters. There’s nothing awkward in the way the game presents the story and challenges, and everything wraps up nicely by the end of the journey. The story was well-paced and hit just the right place on the spectrum between “overwhelming” and “underwhelming”. And though the content is child-friendly, it’s just as engaging for the older audience.

## Well Done, Jerry!

The challenges in _The Night of the Rabbit_ are usually straightforward, but there are some challenges that had me searching the internet in frustration. Be aware that you also might have to resort to looking up solutions because the solution to a challenge could be too obscure. The ones I could solve on my own, though, had me feeling accomplished.

In addition to the storyline, there’s a couple of minigames to partake in. Those who are completionists will thoroughly enjoy a game of “I Spy”; stickers of cute hamsters are plastered in select areas of Mousewood. And for those who love card games, you’ll be pleased to know that the game, Quartet, is both simple and fun. Not to mention the cards are also collectibles, an extra incentive to play it. I unfortunately did not collect all of the stickers or the cards during my playthrough. The artwork is so fantastic that I regret not spending more time looking for each one.

## Time To Go Home

I really loved playing _The Night of the Rabbit_ from start to finish. One of the things that will stick with me most from this game is the soundtrack. Sometimes I’ll put on the music while I do work—you can hear the love that went into making the game as immersive and magical as possible. While some of the puzzles were hard to figure out, it was a worthwhile journey to embark on. _The Night of the Rabbit_ is a storybook come to life, especially as Jerry is thrust from the mundane world to the very eventful Mousewood.
