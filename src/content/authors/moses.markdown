bio: I'm a life-long gamer, and have been since I was a youngin' playing Tales of Symphonia and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (with the original bongos!) on the Nintendo GameCube. As a writer by trade, I thoroughly enjoy games with a strong story, believable characters and a world I can truly get lost in. Analyzing and breaking down the elements that make an amazing video game are some of my favorite parts of playing them. I believe video games with a tale worth telling deserve the opportunity to be appreciated, studied and enjoyed as much as any other novel on a bookshelf or piece of art hanging in one's home.
