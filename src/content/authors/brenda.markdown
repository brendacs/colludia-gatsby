bio: I like to play and voice thoughts about all sorts of indie games, but have an inclination towards anything with really beautiful pixel or 2D art, smooth mechanics, and a really good story. I mainly play on my Nintendo Switch and Mac (yes, really). If I'm not gaming or writing, I'm probably playing guitar, reading about personal finance and investing, or coding up yet another web app.
