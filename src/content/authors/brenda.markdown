bio: Hi! I'm Brenda. Currently, I'm a San Francisco-based software engineer by day and an interdisciplinary writer by night. Aside from software engineering and writing, I'm an entrepreneur at heart. I am always coding up apps, creating my own websites and blogs, and brainstorming ideas with friends. One of those ideas became the meticulously designed indie gaming website Indie Story Games, inspired by my love for great UI, indie games, and interactive stories. If I'm not gaming or writing, I'm probably playing guitar, reading about personal finance and investing, or coding up yet another web app.
