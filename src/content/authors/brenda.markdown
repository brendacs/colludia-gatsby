bio: I like to play, and voice thoughts about, all sorts of indie games, but have an inclination towards anything with really beautiful and detailed pixel or 2D art, smooth mechanics, and a really good story. I mainly play on my Nintendo Switch and my Mac (yes, really). If I'm not gaming and writing, I'm probably playing guitar, reading a psychology book, or coding up yet another web app.
