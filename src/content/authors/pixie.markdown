bio:       I'm a British lass hailing from the north of England and have been obsessed with gaming since around 5 years old. Barely a day goes by without at least a little time dedicated to it and being able to combine that love with a love for writing is a dream. I also have a YouTube and Twitch channel focusing mainly on retro and indie games. Outside of the gaming world, I'm a trained actor and singer with a penchant for colourful makeup, clothing and floral headwear. If it's colourful, I have to have it!
