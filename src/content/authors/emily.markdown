bio: I'm a student, gamer, and writer who is obsessed with the art of storytelling. Outside of writing fiction and esports articles, I love to analyze the emotional journeys that less well-known narrative-heavy games inspire at Indie Story Games. Always hungry for improvement, I study different forms of storytelling mediums in my free time such as movies, TV shows, books, and all kinds of comics.
