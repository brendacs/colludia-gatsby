# Become a Writer at Colludia

We always need more writers who are passionate about indie games (especially those with a story) and the indie game development community. We have two types of writers, both with flexible schedules. You can read more about the responsibilities of each below.

To apply, email us at [info@colludia.com](mailto:info@colludia.com) letting us know which position you're interested in, a description of yourself of any length, and why you'd like to join us. Preferably, attach an old (or new) writing sample or two on any topic, and we'll be in touch!

## Staff Writer

- Write high quality indie game reviews and articles on a regular basis
- Stick to a schedule that you choose (choices range from daily to biweekly)
- Attend casual biweekly staff meetings where we discuss updates, progress, and just chat with like-minded individuals
- Have fun at Colludia game nights, if you choose to attend!

Note: We use biweekly in the sense of once every two weeks.

## Contributing Writer

- Write high quality indie game reviews and articles
- Attend casual biweekly staff meetings where we discuss updates, progress, and just chat with like-minded individuals at least once a month
- Have fun at Colludia game nights, if you choose to attend!

Note: We use biweekly in the sense of once every two weeks.

## Compensation

Though we can't offer compensation at this time, we'll give review copies of games whenever we have them and post any portfolio, social media, or other personal links on your author bio. We know "compensation through exposure" isn't the best model, but this is a passion project that we're trying to grow and would love to have those who believe in us join our journey.
